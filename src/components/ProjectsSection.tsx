              <p>For my GradeMe project, I worked with a team using Agile to build a grade calculator with account creation and grade management features. 
              I handled the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and used Jest for unit testing, focusing on implementing the main functionality of the website.</p>

              <p>For the "Cancer Cell Identifier" project during the Inspirit AI Innovators Fellowship, I developed a logistic regression model to classify cell images as cancerous or benign. 
              I used NumPy, Pandas, sklearn, and a Google API to build and train the model.</p>

              <h3>Graph Algorithm Simulation</h3>
              <p>For my CS 310 class, I used Java to develop an advanced graph data structure and simulate Kruskalâ€™s Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm. 
              The framework I created is designed to be easily extended, allowing for the exploration of various graph-related algorithms and concepts in the future.</p>
